# Fake-Job-Post-Prediction
ML-based system to detect fake job postings using text classification

# Fake Job Post Prediction

This project aims to identify and classify fake job postings using machine learning
and natural language processing techniques. It helps in reducing online recruitment
fraud by analyzing job post content and patterns.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- TF-IDF Vectorization  

## Project Description
The system processes job post descriptions, performs text preprocessing, and applies
machine learning models to classify job postings as real or fake based on learned
features from historical data.

## Key Features
- Text preprocessing and feature extraction  
- Machine learning–based classification  
- Detection of potentially fraudulent job postings  

## Outcome
- Built a working ML model for fake job post detection  
- Gained hands-on experience with NLP and text classification  

## Use Case
This project can be useful for job portals, recruiters, and job seekers to identify
suspicious or fraudulent job postings.
