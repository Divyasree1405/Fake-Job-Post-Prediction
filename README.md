ML-based system to detect fake job postings using text classification

# Fake Job Post Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent job postings using machine learning and
deep learning techniques. With the rapid growth of online recruitment platforms, fake
job advertisements have become a serious concern for job seekers. This system aims to
classify job posts as **Real** or **Fake** to help reduce online recruitment fraud.

## Project Overview
Fake job postings often aim to collect personal information or extract money from job
seekers. This project analyzes job advertisement data and applies multiple machine
learning models to identify fraudulent patterns and predict fake job postings with
high accuracy.

## Dataset
- Employment Scam Aegean Dataset (EMSCAD)
- Approximately **18,000 job postings**
- Contains both genuine and fraudulent job advertisements
- Includes attributes such as job title, location, employment type, company details,
  experience level, education, and fraud label

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- Flask (for web-based interaction)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

## Methodology
1. Data collection and preprocessing  
2. Handling missing values and categorical feature encoding  
3. Feature selection and transformation  
4. Model training and testing  
5. Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  

## Algorithms Implemented
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Naive Bayes  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Decision Tree  
- Deep Neural Network (DNN)  

## Results
- Among traditional machine learning models, **Random Forest** performed best
- **Deep Neural Network** achieved the highest accuracy (approximately **97–99%**)
- The system effectively distinguishes between real and fake job postings

## Key Features
- Automated fake job post detection
- Comparative study of multiple ML and DL algorithms
- Accuracy visualization using charts
- User interaction through a web interface

## Use Case
- Job portals to filter fraudulent job postings
- Job seekers to identify suspicious listings
- Recruitment platforms to improve trust and reliability

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates that machine learning and deep learning techniques can be
effectively used to detect fake job postings. The proposed system improves safety and
reduces the risk of online recruitment fraud for job seekers.

## Future Scope
- Integration with real-time job portals
- Use of advanced NLP models such as BERT or transformers
- Deployment as a browser extension or API service
- Continuous learning using new job posting data
